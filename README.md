# SendCode Chat App Swift

Send Code is my first proper app on swift, for my 6th semester internship at House Of Code.

It uses Firebase as the main cloud backend, authentication, storage and database.

I have used a VIPER architecture approach and proper coding techniques:
```bash
Helpers: Can be extensions or classes that can assist in decision making
Repository: Where data communication lives
Components: Reuseable view components
Modules: The VIPER modules
Managers: Stuff that manages some kind of business logic
```

## Branch Setup
```bash
master
develop
```

##Dependencies and Setup


```python
Currently it includes:

Login screen (email + facebook + apple sign in)
Logged in state with tabbar + several subcontrolloers and flows
Edit user screen including avatar
Push handling and deep linking
Cool libraries
Realm

===== SETUP =====
Clone
Navigate to the folder with your terminal
Run in terminal: pod install
Done!
```
